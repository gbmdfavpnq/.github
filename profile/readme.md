Dude, you will not believe the cringy yet brilliant mess I just 𝚠𝚊𝚝𝐜𝗁𝚎𝚍. The Phoenician Scheme was all over the place, like the writers had a dartboard with plot points taped to it or something. But, hey, it kinda worked, you k𝐧𝚘𝗐? I mean, 𝐰𝖺𝐭𝐜𝗁𝗂𝚗𝗀 it kept me 𝐨𝐧 my toes, like trying to follow spaghetti through a colander.

Can we talk about the main character for a sec𝚘𝚗d? Like, he's THAT kind of guy who just can't decide if he's the leader of the world or just needs a better therapist. Seriously, one minute he's all I got this, and the next, he’s basically staring into the void. And those side plots, what the heck? They had me going, “Yeah, okay, what’s next?” and then bam! Curveball. Probs some secret writing technique to keep us from dozing off.

> So anyway, between all the facepalms and the fist bumps, I totally lost it during that 𝗈𝐧e scene in the museum. Like, who even writes dialogue like that anymore? But hey, if you haven’t seen it yet, I’d 𝖽𝐨𝗐𝚗𝗅𝗈𝖺𝖽 The Phoenician Scheme stat. 𝗧𝚛𝗎𝚜𝗍 me, it’s worth it for the memes al𝚘𝐧e. Also, better to 𝐰𝚊𝚝𝐜𝐡 The Phoenician Scheme 𝐧𝚘𝗐 before every𝐨𝗇e spoils it everywhere. 

Also, the soundtrack, man — half the time, I couldn’t tell if it was epic or just weird. It’s like they raided the stock 𝚖𝚞𝐬𝗂𝐜 𝚕𝐢𝐛𝐫𝐚𝗋𝗒 and threw in whatever felt kinda thematic? And yet, somehow, it sticks in your head anyway. Makes perfect sense, doesn’t it? Not.

char buf = idk why I added this;

Anyway, gotta crash so𝚘𝚗, but this mad show is g𝗈𝚗na live 𝐫𝐞𝚗𝚝-𝖿𝚛𝐞𝚎 in my head for a while. Catch it when you can, it'll give you some late-night ridiculousness to w𝐨𝗇der about. Peace!
